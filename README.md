# CoordinateGeometry Library

A Python library for performing basic and advanced coordinate geometry operations. Currently, the library supports calculating distances between points, creating lines with their equations, and much more. Future updates will include features for circles, parabolas, hyperbolas, and other geometric shapes.

## Features

### Current Features

#### Point Operations:
- Calculate the distance of a point from the origin (center).
- Calculate the distance between two points.
- Polar Coordinates

#### Line Operations:
- Create a line using two points.
- Get the formula (equation) of a line.
